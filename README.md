# Warhammer Leaderboard
This is the source code for our Warhammer 40k leaderboard for DH2642 project assignment in 2024. 

The main features are to create, track and present games played for the tabletop game **Warhammer 40k** and hold and present that data in an easily digestible way.

The features are:
- Navigation bar for easy site navigation
- Log-in function
- Username creation
- Creating and saving matches for logged-in users
- Persistence for match creation (refreshing the website does not clear the Match Creator)
- User authentication/match tracking
- Website styling using Material UI
- A list of matches created by all users
- Match filtering and search functionality
- Clickable matches for more match details

For the scope of this project, we have decided to limit the matches to two players, as well as making all matches public.
