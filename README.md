# Warhammer Leaderboard
This is the source code for our warhammer leaderboard dynwebb 2024 project, it's supposed to track games played for the tabletop game Warhammer 40k and hold and present that data in an easily digestible way.

Right now the project is pretty barebones but has a full firestore integration as well as most of the backend developed but is lacking the following features:

- Match detail view
- User authentication/match tracking
- Extensive css work 
- Nav bar for easy site navigation
